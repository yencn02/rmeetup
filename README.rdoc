= rMeetup

A simple Ruby gem to access the Meetup API.

== Code Sample

Sample code is worth a thousand words:

  RMeetup::Client.api_key = "API_KEY"
  results = RMeetup::Client.fetch(:events,{:zip => "ZIP_CODE"})
  results.each do |result|
    # Do something with the result
  end
  
RMeetup::Client.fetch takes a data model type and set of options as arguments. Possible data models are:

* :topics
* :cities
* :members
* :rsvps
* :events
* :groups
* :comments
* :photos
 
The options that may be passed can be found on the Meetup API documentation. Please see http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/ and look up the model that you are calling (i.e. for :events, look at the API call "GET /events" at http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/events/).

== Installation

  gem install rMeetup
